    "\n",
    "### **Overview**\n",
    "This project focuses on creating a concise financial report for companies or stocks using the latest economic and market data. By leveraging open-source tools and APIs, we aim to simplify the process without relying on training or fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) or machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "- Build a financial report using real-time economic indicators from the **Financial Modeling Prep API**.\n",
    "- Streamline data processing and retrieval to produce accurate and actionable insights.\n",
    "- Avoid the computational overhead of training custom AI models by utilizing pre-trained open-source models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **Methodology**\n",
    "1. **Data Retrieval**:  \n",
    "   Fetch the latest company metrics and market economic indicators using the Financial Modeling Prep API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**:  \n",
    "   Process the retrieved data using Python and save it in a structured CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Database**:  \n",
    "   Load the processed data into a vector database using an embedding model from Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **RAG QA Chain**:  \n",
    "   Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with **LangChain** and the **Falcon 7B LLM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**:  \n",

    "### RAG Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for generating detailed financial reports using a Hugging Face large language model (LLM) and a Chroma-based retriever. Here's an overview of each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the LLM:\n",
    "   - The `HuggingFaceHub` is used to load the `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` model.\n",
    "   - A low `temperature` of 0.1 is set for more deterministic outputs, and an API key is provided for access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initialize the Retriever:\n",
    "   - A retriever is created from the Chroma vector database, enabling the retrieval of the top 2 most relevant documents (`search_kwargs={\"k\": 2}`) based on the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define the Prompt Template:\n",
    "   - A prompt template is created to instruct the LLM to act as a financial market expert, using the retrieved context (`{context}`) and the user query (`{question}`) to generate a comprehensive financial report.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Retrieve Relevant Context:\n",
    "   - The retriever fetches the most relevant documents from the vector database based on the user's prompt. This step ensures the model has the necessary context for answering the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Initialize the Retrieval Chain**:\n",
    "   - The `RetrievalQA` chain combines the retriever and the LLM into a single pipeline.\n",
    "   - The retrieved context is passed through the prompt template to guide the LLM in generating accurate and detailed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Query the Model:\n",
    "   - The user's prompt is passed to the RAG pipeline, which retrieves relevant context from vector database and generates a detailed financial report using the LLM.\n",
    "   - The response is printed to display the generated financial report.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pipeline efficiently combines document retrieval and generative AI to provide context-aware and accurate outputs."
